# Documentation

If you simply wish to reproduce the experiments,
the main entry points are the `run_exp_*.py` files.

If you wish to understand the codebase
in depth, then we recommend reading the tests.
These help document the interfaces in the codebase,
and show how the different pieces fit together.
Alternatively, you could read `run_exp_suite.py`
as a starting point and then follow references from there.

The names of modules, classes,
and functions are designed to be self-documenting.
Doc strings are used in those places where we feel it helps
understand the design or purpose of specific parts of the code.
